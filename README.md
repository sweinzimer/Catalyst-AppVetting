## About Catalyst NW, and What this Software Does

Catalyst NW is an organization who helps under-resourced individuals make necessary repairs to their homes.  They fix leaking roofs, rotten floors, do electrical and plumbing work, repair decks and siding, paint, grounds-clearing, etc... They are a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization dedicated to helping those in need.

In order for people to request help, they need to fill out an application form.  A Catalyst staff member then goes through a financial vetting process and site assessment before a project is approved. This software takes that application form, and moves the data around for Catalyst Vetting Agents and Site Assessors in a meaningful way, in order to keep track of applications, take notes, and make decisions based on the additional information gathered along the way.

**Software Structure**
* Application form - done by client (someone who needs work done)
* Application View - available to Catalyst Vetting Agents
* Vetting Worksheet - for vetting agents to work through with the client, and keep track of financial documentation, and initial work items needed by the client.
* Site Assessment View - available to Site Assessors to take notes regarding the potential work-site, verify existing work items, and add new ones if necessary.
* Project View - summarizes work items and other necessary data, allowing Project Managers to keep track of materials needed, costs, project date, checklists, partners, leaders and other things needed for project management.
