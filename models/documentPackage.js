/**
 * This file represents the document schema for the entire DOCUMENT PACKAGE
 * This is the master file for a client. Imagine it as a section in a filing
 * cabinet that holds the application, financial, property, handle-it and
 * project information. A 'folder' to hold a bunch of forms.
 *
 * This schema will create a mongoDB 'document'.
 * The document will have values, like '_id', and sub-documents,
 * like 'applications'.
 * A sub-document can have sub-documents or values.
 *
 *  Items on the left of the colon are database ID values.
 *  Items on the right of the colon are the data types allowed.
 *
 * Allowable types are:
 *     String      Number
 *     Date        Buffer
 *     Boolean     Mixed
 *     ObjectId    Array
 *
 * ObjectId is similar to a primary key in a relationship based database.
